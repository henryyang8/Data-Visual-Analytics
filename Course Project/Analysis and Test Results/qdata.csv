That would be more intuitive to click on.","Really cool idea. It just took me a while to figure out that you click on the bar graph to add the attraction to the itinerary.  I also had to complete my search a few times, with a few different places until Buckingham Palace worked. Once I figured everything out, the map tool was very cool. That was my favorite part of the app and that is an awesome idea to be able to put in a list of locations and have the route be calculated. That was easier to use than Google Maps as you can't submit a list of locations to Google Maps (that I am aware of). Overall though, really solid idea and good job!!!",Los Angeles
